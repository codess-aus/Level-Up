# Hacktoberfest Guidelines

We want you to be successful in making your First (2nd, 3rd or 4th) Pull Request. So we have implemented a few things to make it easier for you:

* Hacktoberfest Issues Template - If you go to the [Issues](https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/issues) Tab at the top of the repository and pick a Hacktoberfest issue, it will tell you exactly what you need to do.
* [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - will give you a more detailed guide on what to do.
* Bots will thank you for your first issue with a Gif, watch out for bad behaviour, and hopefully... assign your Pull Requests to us. You can also ask them to add you as a contributor to the repository and they will.
* We're happy to help, put a comment on an issue if you get stuck and have questions
* Please don't take more than one issue, we'd like to be able to give all #Hacktoberfest people a chance to make one PR here

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- if you want to add a new resource you should have used it and know that it is good
- Use the following format: `| [Name](Resource URL) | Author | Step | Comments |`
- Order the entry within its section based on it's simplicity.
- Mention in pull request clearly why you think the resource deserves to be in the list.
- Add yourself to the list of contributors by going to the bottom of the README.MD and adding yourself to the list of Contributors using the same formatting as those before you

<!---
### `@all-contributors add`
 Comment on Issue or Pull Request, asking @all-contributors to add a contributor:

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contributions>
```
**\<contribution>**: See the [Emoji Key (Contribution Types Reference)](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key) for a list of valid `contribution` types.

The bot will then create a Pull Request to add the contributor, then reply with the pull request details.

Thank you and enjoy Hacktoberfest!
