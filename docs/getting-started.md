# Getting Started Guide

This guide will help you get started contributing on this repository. 

## Beginners Only
Contributing during **Hacktoberfest** is reserved for people who are new to Open Source. We know that the process of creating a pull request is the biggest barrier for new contributors. This respository is for you üíù

## What you need to know
Nothing. This is where you start and the resources contained herein will help you build the skills and the confidence you need to become an active and contributing member of the Open-Source Community - and a clean coder as well.

If you would like to contribute to this repository - have at it. First-Timers Welcome! Check the issues and either add one, or comment on one. Then [Branch, commit, pull - start at step2](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

If you are not confident working in the command-line (I confess, I never use it, if I don't have to) - Then you can do it all in the browser window or use a nice GUI tool called GitHub Desktop. This is the step-by-step for making your Pull Request for this Project using that - [GitHub Desktop Steps](https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/docs/github-desktop-tutorial.md)

Remember to observe the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/code_of_conduct.md) - by which we mean, in short - Be Kind, Be Positive, Be Helpful

We don't want people to be overwhelmed with too many choices, or demotivated by content that is not accessible to beginners. Make suggestions for resources/people that you have used yourself and comes with your most heartfelt recommendation.

## Step by Step
* üôã Claim an issue: Comment on it.
* Create a New Branch [How to branch, Commit, Pull, Merge - start at step2](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
* Make your change - I use [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) so I don't have to do anything via the command-line, but if you like the command-line git on with it ;-)
* Commit it [Make it a good one](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/git-commit-message-5e21)
* Make a Pull Request [Tell us what you did](https://github.blog/2015-01-21-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request/)
* We'll review it and merge it in
* Add yourself to the list of contributors by going to the bottom of the README.MD and adding yourself using the same formatting as those before you
