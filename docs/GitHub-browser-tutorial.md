# GitHub Edit in Browser Tutorial for 10-easy-steps

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. But open source is all about collaboration & working together. We wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

Reading articles & watching tutorials can help, but what comes better than actually doing the stuff without messing up anything. This project aims at providing guidance & simplifying the way rookies make their first contribution. Remember the more relaxed you are the better you learn. If you are looking for making your first contribution just follow the simple steps below. We promise you, it will be fun.

## Comment on the Issue

## The Bot Assigns a Branch to the Issue

Once it's assigned to you, the Bot will Create a Branch for the Issue (but if you can't wait, just skip that part and go on anyway).
Do not worry, you cannot directly edit the main repository, if you try, it will create a fork (your own copy) for you. You cannot break this, have no fear.

## Edit the Readme.md

On the top right hand side there is a little picture of a pen (I've highlighted it in yellow) - Click on that to edit the file

## You Can Only Edit Your Own Copy

You might get a warning to say you can't make a change to a project you don't have access to. Don't worry, it will make a copy for you to edit.

## Make Your Change

Go down to the line you want to change, and edit and add into the page

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/6%20make%20your%20change.PNG" alt="Edit File" />

## Commit and Propose (very romantic)

Type Clearly and Concisely what your change is. Quote your Issue number if this is the resolution to one. Propose your change.

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/7%20make%20a%20clear%20commit%20statement%20and%20propose.PNG" alt="Commit Statement" />

## Pull Me In

Now you want to merge your changes into the main repo - so you create the Pull Request (now it's happening!)

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/8%20create%20PR.PNG" alt="Create Pull Request" />

## Make Your Vows

Even though you have committed and proposed, when we make a Pull Request - we are really doing it. This is the time to detail clearly what you will change. Based on this, your change will be accepted or rejected.

Sometimes there are templates, prompting you for appropriate information for your Pull Request. Fill it in as completely as you can. The better the information, the more likely it will be approved.

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/9%20make%20a%20clear%20PR%20request%20comment%20and%20Pull.PNG" alt="Create Pull Request" />

## Wait for Merge or Review

Now you wait. You don't have access to the Main Repository, so all you can do is wait and see if your change is accepted. If there is some automation or bots in play, it may be done very quickly.

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/10%20Wait%20for%20merge.PNG" alt="Wait for Merge" />

## Watch the bots

Sometimes bots will approve, sometimes requests or comments will come up. Watch and see.

## Reviewer Requested

A reviewer might check your change or a bot might. No need to worry, all is well.

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/12%20Reviewer%20checks%20it.PNG" alt="Reviewer Requested" />

## Reviewer Notified

Now you are seeing the Reviewers view, they are notified they need to check the Pull Request.

## Reviewers View

They'll look at what has changed. The red lines have been removed, the green lines have been added.

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/14%20Files%20Changed.PNG" alt="Changed Files" />

## Approved!

All being well, they'll approve it. Else, they might have some feedback or changes they need

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/15%20approves.PNG" alt="Approved" />

## Merge Pull Request

Then they'll be asked to Merge the Pull Request

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/16%20merges.PNG" alt="Merge Pull Request" />

## Bot Merges Approved Pull Requests

Or, because the PR has been reviewed and approved, the bot is allowed to automatically make the merge.

## Close Your Issue

Now, you can close the issue linked to your Pull Request, quoting the issue number in it - and you are done.

<img style="left;" src="https://github.com/msandfor/10-Easy-Steps/blob/master/assets/18%20Close%20the%20issue%20linked%20to%20your%20PR.PNG" alt="Close Your Issue" />

Congratulations - You just completed the standard _fork -> clone -> edit -> PR_ workflow that you'll encounter often as a contributor and you did it all in the browser window!
